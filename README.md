# Custom heap allocator/malloc implementation
Possibly/probably biting off more than we can chew here. 

What do we need to do 

 - figure out what methods we need to build: ``malloc``, ``free``, ``realloc``, etc?
 - see how the existing malloc implementation works
 - learn about allocation strategies and block structure
 - all the rest
